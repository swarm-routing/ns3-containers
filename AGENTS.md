# AGENTS.md — guide for AI coding agents

Operational guide for LLM agents working in `swarm-routing/ns3-containers`. Read this
before changing anything. Org-wide conventions:
[`swarm-routing/.github` CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Shape and rules mirror
[AntHocNet's AGENTS.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/AGENTS.md), the source repository.

## What this repo is

Builds and publishes `ghcr.io/swarm-routing/ns3-dev` (public): ns-3
pre-configured and pre-built with Ninja at `/opt/ns-3`, so a downstream contrib
module compiles alone in seconds. Automatic pipelines build only the release
ns-3 supports (its latest); older releases are built on demand and kept as
history (`tools/ns3_matrix.py`; bases and tags: README "Which image"). Profiles: `default` (ns-3 `-d default`, the plain `:<ver>` tag),
`debug` (CI default), `sanitized` (ASan+LSan+UBSan), `optimized` (ns-3
`-d release`, campaigns only). Bases: Ubuntu 24.04 (default), Debian 13,
Debian 13 slim, Alpine (experimental). `ns3-build-contrib` links mounted
modules into the tree and builds them.

```

in detail, read its line in [`docs/layout.md`](docs/layout.md).

## Build & verify

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools                               # matrix generator
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg NS3_VERSION=3.48 \
    --build-arg BUILD_PROFILE=debug -t ns3-dev:3.48-debug .        # ~8-15 min on 4 cores
EXPECT_VERSION=3.48 EXPECT_PROFILE=debug EXPECT_OS=ubuntu \
    test/run.sh ns3-dev:3.48-debug                                 # every test stage, as CI runs them
test/downstream.sh --check                                         # the consumer list parses (no docker)
test/downstream.sh ns3-dev:3.48-debug                              # every org module builds and passes on the image (latest-* gate)
hadolint docker/Dockerfile                                       # reads .hadolint.yaml; exit 0 required
shellcheck docker/scripts/build-contrib.sh test/*.sh
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml
```

The smoke must report a small Ninja step count (8 today, gate 40): a larger
number means the warm cache was missed. Behind a TLS-intercepting proxy, build
from a scratch copy of the Dockerfile with the proxy CA added; never commit
that layer. The PR's own `publish-images` run is the authoritative check.

## Golden rules (invariants — do not break)

Org-wide (1–9), then this repo's own.

<!-- org-sync:begin org-rules -->
1. **Licensing per directory, as AntHocNet** ([`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md);
   AntHocNet [LICENSING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/LICENSING.md),
   [ADR-0028](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0028-core-is-dual-licensed.md)). A
   simulator-free `core/` and the standalone tooling are `MIT OR GPL-2.0-only`;
   ns-3 modules, the site, docs and data are `GPL-2.0-only`. Every original
   `.h`/`.hpp`/`.cc`/`.cpp`/`.py`/`.sh` starts with
   `// Copyright (c) 2026 Daniel Joppi (https://github.com/swarm-routing)` +
   `// SPDX-License-Identifier: <MIT OR GPL-2.0-only | GPL-2.0-only>` (`#`
   comments where needed), matching its directory in `LICENSING.md`; an
   outside contributor may add their own `Copyright (c) <year> <Name>` line
   beneath the org line, never replace it, and signs off every commit (DCO,
   CONTRIBUTING "Outside contributions"). CI (`reusable-licence-check.yml`)
   checks the SPDX line, and the org line's place when a header names more
   than one holder; a header with a single, other holder (a replaced org line,
   or third-party code) passes it, so review catches that. A new directory
   gets its row in `LICENSING.md` in the same PR.
2. **The licence boundary only goes one way.** GPL code may use the dual
   parts; dual code never pulls GPL-only code in: a `core/` file includes only
   the C++ standard library, other `core/` files and the dual-licensed `core/`
   of a dependency pinned by commit and declared as the `core-deps` input of
   every workflow that runs the licence check (one calling
   `reusable-licence-check.yml`, or one calling `reusable-ns3-ci.yml`, which
   forwards it; workflow file names differ per repo), each with the same pin,
   with `core-roots` naming the repo's own `core/`
   (without it the check skips core includes; a protocol's `core/` on
   swarm-core's; CI checks it, `check-headers.py --core-dep`), and a dual script imports no GPL-only code. Code coming from AntHocNet keeps its
   licence: its `core/`/`tools/` (dual) may land in dual or GPL paths here; its
   `ns3/` modules and `web/` (GPL-2.0-only) only in GPL paths. Third-party code
   (AntHocNet's vendored `aomdv`/`gpsr`, IITP RAS) lands only in GPL paths with
   its provenance recorded. Write clean implementations against public ns-3
   interfaces rather than copying ns-3's `src/aodv`/`src/olsr`.
3. **Wire formats are POD + versioned.** Control headers are
   simulator-independent POD structs with bounds-checked little-endian
   readers/writers, a leading version byte, and deterministic roundtrip + fuzz
   tests. Changing a field or its units bumps the version byte.
4. **No contrib module named `core`** (collides with ns-3's `src/core`). The
   shared module is `swarm-core` (`#include "ns3/swarm-core-module.h"`), and
   every protocol builds on it, AntHocNet included: `core/` on its `core/`, the
   ns-3 adapter on `SwarmRoutingBase` (swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#14).
5. **Determinism.** A fixed `--seed=<N>` gives byte-identical output. All
   randomness through the simulator's seeded streams or an injected RNG port;
   never libc `rand()`, wall-clock time, or unordered-container iteration order
   in anything that reaches an output.
6. **Comparisons are paired.** Per-seed deltas across >= 20 seeds, emitting the
   canonical `##CONFIG##`, `##RUN##`, `##BENCH##`, `##DIAG##` lines. A
   comparator arm (a protocol we did not design) counts only after its three
   gates: a fidelity sheet from its paper, the per-PR delivery smoke, and an
   anchor reproducing the paper's own trend.
7. **Keep bounded structures bounded** (visited paths, dedup histories, queues
   carry a configured cap).
8. **CI hygiene.** Actions pinned by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment;
   buildx caches scoped per profile; transient artifacts `retention-days` <= 7.
   Every job that runs steps has a `timeout-minutes` cap (a job that only
   calls a reusable workflow cannot take one: the called workflow's jobs carry it), and every apt, npm or installer step
   its own, sized from recent green runs; `apt-get update` runs with
   `--error-on=any` inside a shell retry. Ubuntu mirror outages are the usual
   cause of a red run.
9. **Nothing shipped depends on `.claude/`.** Skills hold procedures; scripts
   that anything shipped needs live in `tools/` (AntHocNet ADR-0014).
<!-- org-sync:end org-rules -->
10. **The configure line is shared.** `docker/Dockerfile` and `build-contrib.sh` must pass identical profile flags, `--enable-examples --enable-tests --disable-werror` and module list (the Dockerfile records them in `/opt/ns-3/.swarm-configure.env`); only the contrib list, the examples/tests filter and the quality hook's cache variables (`docker/scripts/swarm-quality.cmake`, which changes only the contrib modules' targets) may differ. Drift forces a full ns-3 rebuild in every downstream job — the smoke's step-count gate catches it.
11. **`optimized` is ns-3's `release` profile, never ns-3's `optimized`** (`-march=native` makes an image SIGILL on another CPU).
12. **CI consumes `debug`/`sanitized`, never `optimized`.** Asserts catch real bugs (AntHocNet #123).
13. **Pinned inputs.** The base image by digest; actions by SHA. A published number pins the immutable `:<ver>-<profile>-<sha7>` tag, not the rolling one.
14. **One buildx cache scope per version x base x profile** (`mode=max`, registry cache in `ns3-dev-cache`); delete a scope's tag when its version stops being the supported release.
15. **The version list is generated, never typed.** `tools/ns3_matrix.py` reads upstream tags; a hand-pinned version would silently stop following ns-3's supported release.
16. **Automatic pipelines build only the release ns-3 supports** (its latest; the generator's default). Older releases are history: never rebuild them as a side effect; the `versions` input is a deliberate, manual, on-demand build.
17. **What is tested is what is tagged.** Each image is built once; every test runs on that build by digest, in the same run; tags are a carbon copy of that digest (`imagetools create`), never a rebuild. A new test stage goes into `test/run.sh`, so automatic and on-demand builds (and fork PRs) all run it (#36, #37). An image may be tested in parallel jobs (`split` in `test/ns3-suites.txt`, #86), all on the same digest in the same run; promote needs every one of them, and `test/run.sh` with no option still runs everything. PRs never tag; `main` runs every stage on every image, each with its profile's whole unit group (`full` on every debug and sanitized image, `main-only` suites included), before it promotes the digest, so every published image is tested with every suite. On a PR only, two things are smaller: the Debian, slim and Alpine images run the `light` unit group (`UNIT_SET`, set by the workflow from the event and the matrix entry; maintainer decision on #87), Ubuntu `debug` and `sanitized` keep `full`; and every image leaves out the suites on `test/ns3-suites.txt`'s `main-only` line (`UNIT_PR=1`; today `ns3-tcp-cubic`, maintainer decision (c) on #86), saying so in the job log and summary. A run without `UNIT_SET` and `UNIT_PR` (a local run, a schedule or dispatch run, a push to `main`) runs the profile's whole group. A PR also tests only the images it affects (maintainer decision, 2026-11-11; #86, #87; `tools/pr_tests.py`, the `select` job): an image whose content (layers and config without the per-build `revision` and `build-run` labels) equals the image its versioned tag points to (what `main` last tested and promoted) is not tested again when no test input (`test/`, `tools/ns3_matrix.py`, `tools/pass_markers.py`, `tools/pr_tests.py`, `publish-images.yml`, `.trivyignore`) changed since the commit `main` tested it at; when only test inputs changed, the stages they feed run on the representative images only: Ubuntu `debug`, `sanitized` and `optimized`, Debian `debug`, slim `default` and Alpine `debug` (`REPRESENTATIVES` in `tools/ns3_matrix.py`: every base and every profile once); an image whose content differs runs every test job. Fork PRs make the same choice read-only, in their build job. The step summary has a line per image (e.g. "unchanged digest, already tested on main"); `images gate` passes when images are skipped. A known upstream bug is a `test/known-failures.txt` entry for one exact ns-3 version with its tracking issue, never a skipped or loosened check.

## Conventions

<!-- org-sync:begin conventions -->
- Issues follow the org taxonomy ([CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues), from
  [AntHocNet ADR-0013](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-track-bugs-and-findings-as-issues.md)): one type label
  (`bug`/`enhancement`/`chore`/`documentation`/`verification`, plus `epic` for
  umbrellas), area label(s) (`protocol`/`adapter`/`ns3`/`benchmark`/
  `observability`/`packaging`/`learn-site`/`literature`), one `model:*`
  suggestion (a model on the Claude Pro plan), one `priority:P1|P2|P3` on
  non-epic issues (none on an epic), a
  `release:vX.Y.Z` label only when a release in the repository's ladder
  (`docs/roadmap.md`; until it lands, the org ROADMAP's release train)
  gates the issue: that label set is the version's scope,
  and the version is released when its issues are done (CONTRIBUTING
  "Cutting a release"). Labels come from `labels.json` via the `sync-labels`
  workflow, the shared `release:v0.1.0` to `release:v0.4.0` and
  `release:v1.0.0` among them; a version outside that set is added to
  `swarm-routing/.github`'s `labels.json` (and CONTRIBUTING's label table)
  when a ladder needs it, and reaches a repository when its `sync-labels` runs
  (monthly, or dispatched after the change merges),
  or, in a repository that keeps its own release labels (AntHocNet), created
  there with `gh label create release:vX.Y.Z` when its ladder adds the version.
- Issue bodies: **Context** (evidence, numbers, links) · **Scope** ·
  **Acceptance criteria** (checkboxes) · **Depends on** (cross-repo form
  `swarm-routing/<repo>#N`) · **References**. Children of an epic say "Part of
  #N" and are linked as sub-issues. Comments you post end with the Claude Code
  footer.
- Issues migrated from AntHocNet carry `migrated` and start with *Migrated from
  `danieljoppi/AntHocNet#N`*.
- Epics are listed where contributors look. In a public repository, this
  README's `## Epics` section and the org
  [ROADMAP](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#epics)
  are generated from the issues labelled `epic` by `swarm-routing/.github`'s
  `tools/epics/epics.py`. An open epic is Planned (no sub-issue closed) or In
  progress (some closed); it becomes Done or Dropped only when you close the
  epic itself (as completed or as not planned), even if every sub-issue is
  closed. Whenever you change an epic (open, close, rename or re-scope it, add
  or remove its `epic` label) or one of its sub-issues (close, reopen, add,
  unlink), refresh the lists in that PR or the next one. You need
  `swarm-routing/.github` checked out next to this repository and `gh` logged
  in (or `GH_TOKEN` set). Run `python3 ../.github/tools/epics/epics.py readme .`
  in the repository that owns the epic (for a sub-issue of another
  repository's epic, that repository, not this one), then
  `python3 tools/epics/epics.py roadmap ROADMAP.md` and
  `python3 tools/epics/epics.py profile profile/README.md` in `.github`. Never
  edit a generated section by hand; the weekly `epics` workflow in `.github`
  only reports drift. Private repositories are never listed
  and keep no generated section.
- Make minimal, reviewable changes; update the relevant doc/ADR when you change
  a documented decision.
<!-- org-sync:end conventions -->

## Git workflow

<!-- org-sync:begin git-workflow -->
- Branch from `main` (`claude/<short-topic>`), one focused change per PR.
- **Always open a PR to `main`** once the branch is pushed — every change is
  tracked through one.
- **PRs are squash-merged** (the only merge method enabled). The PR title is
  the commit on `main`, so it is a lowercase Conventional Commit
  (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`…, optional scope).
- Push with `git push -u origin <branch>`; merge when CI is green.
- **`main` takes no direct push**, in any repo: its ruleset requires a PR and
  the required checks, not an up-to-date branch. Bots push `bot/<name>` branches
  and open PRs; a release is the bump PR from `bot/release`, tagged after it
  merges (CONTRIBUTING "Cutting a release").
- A PR behind `main` may merge as it is: the ruleset does not require an
  up-to-date branch. Update it first
  (`gh api -X PUT "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/update-branch"`, with
  `<owner>/<repo>` the PR's base repository and `<n>` its number) only when
  `main` changed what it touches (a template, a workflow, a required check),
  then merge after its CI on the updated branch. A
  repository with a merge queue (`merge_queue = true` in its `[settings]`)
  is not updated by hand: enable auto-merge and the queue tests each PR on
  the latest `main` and merges it (CONTRIBUTING "Merge when CI is green").
  Never force-push a branch someone else pushed. A behind `bot/release` PR is the exception:
  dispatch the release `bump` again, so the version and changelog are rebuilt
  on the new `main`.
- **Settings are code.** Repository settings, rulesets, required checks and the
  Actions allowlist change only by a PR to the repo's `[settings]` in
  `.github/org-sync.toml` or to `templates/rulesets/` in `swarm-routing/.github`,
  never in the UI or by a direct API write. A `templates/rulesets/` change
  applies on merge; a repo's `[settings]` change applies when `repo-settings`
  in `swarm-routing/.github` is dispatched with mode `apply` after the merge
  (the daily run only checks). A required check runs on every PR (no `paths:`
  filter; skip work inside a gate job instead) and is named exactly as its
  check run. A new third-party action goes into `defaults.json`
  `selected_actions` (`templates/rulesets/`) before or with the workflow that
  uses it: in the same PR in `swarm-routing/.github`, otherwise merged there
  first, or `repo-settings` refuses the repo.

## Agent skills

The org's procedures ship as the Claude Code plugin **`swarm-routing`**, from
[`swarm-routing/skills`](https://github.com/swarm-routing/skills). This
repository's `.claude/settings.json` enables it, so Claude Code offers a skill
when the task matches its description. Other agents (Codex, Cursor, Copilot, …)
install the same skills with `npx skills add swarm-routing/skills`
([skills.sh](https://skills.sh)). A skill is the procedure; the script does the
work and runs without it (golden rule 9), so an agent without the skill starts
from the script; so does a session that does not read this repository's
settings (some hosted sessions with several repositories do not). If Claude
Code says the plugin is missing (it was called
`org-repo` before 2026-11-09, and a cached marketplace keeps the old list), run
`claude plugin marketplace update swarm-routing` and start a new session.

| Task | Script (any agent) | Skill |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| Bring this repository onto the org templates, or fix their drift | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/org-sync/org_sync.py` | `org-repo` |
| Write or review a protocol's paper-fidelity sheet (`docs/fidelity.md`) | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/fidelity/fidelity.py` | `fidelity-sheet` |
| Check a diff against the org golden rules before a PR or a review | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/protocol-review/check_invariants.py` | `protocol-review` |
| Bring the README, AGENTS/CLAUDE/CONTEXT and docs/ to the org documentation standard | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/docs-review/check_docs.py` | `docs-review` |
| Find new papers on a topic, or confirm a reference (Crossref, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex; free sources only) | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/lit-search/lit_search.py` | `lit-search` |
| Give a repository its docs/references.bib, or review it: every paper and org release it relies on, confirmed from Crossref, DataCite or Zenodo, DOI links first, the fidelity Sources table and CITATION.cff references generated from it | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/fidelity/fidelity.py` (bib), `tools/zenodo/zenodo.py` | `references` |
| Measure what a Claude Code session loads from the agent files (`CLAUDE.md` and its `@` imports, or `AGENTS.md` alone), or where a finished Claude Code session's tokens went, before cutting or adding agent text | `swarm-routing/skills` `tools/token-audit/token_audit.py` | `token-audit` |

A skill only this repository uses lives in its own `.claude/skills/`; a skill
two repositories need moves to the plugin. Skills that file, cite and extract
papers stay in a private library the maintainer keeps; finding
new papers and confirming a reference is public (`lit-search`). A public skill
may point to that library's skills, never carry its content. This section is managed by org-sync: add
a row in `swarm-routing/.github` `templates/agents/skills.md`, not here (an edit
here is undone by the next `org_sync.py apply`).
<!-- org-sync:end skills -->

<!-- org-sync:begin agent-defaults -->
## Working defaults

Condensed from [andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills).

- **Assumptions:** state the ones that matter. Ask only when the choice
  belongs to the maintainer: a default, a published number, a cell, the scope.
  Then give your recommendation and its reason with the question, never the
  options alone. Otherwise pick the sensible option, say which, and keep
  going. Long unattended runs, like campaigns, depend on that.
- **Simplicity:** the least code that solves the task. No speculative
  features, configurability or abstractions for one use.
- **Surgical diffs:** every changed line traces to the request. Match the
  surrounding style. Mention unrelated dead code rather than deleting it, and
  remove only the orphans your own change created.
- **Verifiable goals:** a bug gets a reproducing test first; a refactor passes
  before and after. Finish when the check passes, not when the code looks right.

## Session habits

- **Handoffs are always a ticket.** When a session ends with work in flight, or a
  handoff is asked for, open a GitHub issue from the *Handoff* template (label
  `handoff`); a session that continued a handoff updates that issue instead of
  opening another. Never write a handoff file in the repo. A session that
  continues handed-off work starts from the newest open `handoff` issue for
  that work; a new task starts from the request. Close the issue, and any
  older one it superseded, when the work it hands off is done ([AntHocNet ADR-0013](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-track-bugs-and-findings-as-issues.md) item 5).
- **Attach only the repositories the task needs.** Each attached repository's
  agent files are loaded into every request, whether the task touches it or
  not.
- **Start from the record, not from memory:** the matching `handoff` issue,
  then the issue's acceptance criteria, then `main`. Check a claim against its
  source before it goes into an issue or a PR.
- **Script what repeats.** A check or a lookup run more than a few times
  becomes a script in `tools/` that prints a summary; the model reads the
  verdict, not the raw data (AntHocNet ADR-0014).
- **Measure before cutting or adding agent text:** the `token-audit` skill
  (`swarm-routing/skills` `tools/token-audit/token_audit.py`) prints what a
  session loads and where a finished session's tokens went.

## Response style — caveman (token economy)

Answer in tight, low-filler prose: drop hedging, pleasantries, and preamble; keep
the substance. Fewer output tokens on every reply, same information.

**Carve-out (the record stays full).** Keep byte-for-byte exact — code,
commands, file paths, error text, benchmark numbers. And keep the *durable
record* detailed, never terse: commit messages, PR bodies, ADRs, `docs/`, and
issue / finding threads. Cross-session traceability depends on those being
complete — AntHocNet's AC_BE_NQOS / A2 investigation was only recoverable
because the issue threads were thorough. Caveman the chat, not the record.

## Agent pitfalls

- `gh api … -F body=@file` reads the file; `-f body=@file` posts the literal
  text `@file`.
- When the permission system refuses a command (a merge, say), stop and report
  it. Never retry it another way, and never ask another agent to run it.
- A PR body's `Closes #N` closes the issue on merge; write `Part of #N` while
  acceptance criteria remain open.
- Before saying a tool or check is missing, look at `main` (`git fetch`,
  `origin/main`), not a stale local checkout.
- In an issue, PR or comment, write every issue of another repository in
  full, `swarm-routing/<repo>#N`, also inside a list or a range. A bare `#N`
  links to the repository the text is in: in
  `swarm-routing/AntHocNet#65, #151` the second number points at this
  repository's #151 (swarm-routing/.github#277).
- A sentence in `ROADMAP.md` or an AGENTS.md that calls an issue done is not
  evidence: read the issue's acceptance criteria. On 2026-11-12 nine issues
  described as done had open criteria (swarm-routing/.github#274).
- Change text inside `org-sync:begin/end` markers only through the template
  in `swarm-routing/.github` `templates/`: one PR there, then org-bot's
  `bot/org-sync` refresh PR in each repository. A hand edit per repository
  stays red on `check / org-sync` (swarm-routing/.github#236).
- In a repository with a merge queue, merge by enabling auto-merge (squash);
  a direct merge (`PUT pulls/<n>/merge`) is refused with HTTP 405. Only the
  required checks (`gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main'`, which
  `gh` fills from the checkout) gate a merge: a red or pending report-only
  check (`codecov/patch`, Sonar) is triaged, not waited on. A red `dco` on an
  outside contributor's commit still holds the PR until that author signs
  off; on the maintainer's or an agent's commits it is expected
  (swarm-routing/.github#212). `dco` is not a required check and runs on
  `pull_request` only, so merge an outside contributor's PR, by auto-merge or
  directly, only after `dco` passed on the head commit that merges. Never push
  to an outside contributor's PR: ask them for the change, or make it in a
  follow-up PR after the merge (swarm-routing/.github#288). If the maintainer
  must push to such a PR, first disable auto-merge, or, if the PR is already
  in a merge queue, remove it from the queue (disabling auto-merge does not).
  Re-enable auto-merge, or enqueue it again, only after `dco` passed on the
  new head: GitHub keeps auto-merge on after a push by someone with write
  access, and `dco` is not a required check.
- `review / coderabbit` is a required check (the review gate,
  swarm-routing/.github#294): it passes once CodeRabbit has reviewed the PR,
  once it says it will not, for a draft, or 30 minutes after the PR opened
  (then with one comment). So auto-merge may be enabled at once: the merge
  waits for the gate, and the ruleset holds it while a CodeRabbit thread is
  unresolved. Still read every thread and fix or answer it before resolving.
  Where the gate is not required yet (`gh api
  'repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main'` does not list it), wait first
  with `python3 -I ../.github/tools/pr-status/pr_status.py gate REPO#N`,
  which waits for CodeRabbit alone (swarm-routing/.github#238).
- Never add a `Signed-off-by` trailer, for the maintainer or anyone else: a
  DCO sign-off is a person's own certification (CONTRIBUTING "Outside
  contributions").
- Releases are cut on request only: dispatch the release `bump` when the
  maintainer asks, once the version's `release:vX.Y.Z` issues are done and
  its exit criteria in the ladder (`docs/roadmap.md`, or the org ROADMAP's
  release train until it lands) are met; never approve a gated publish. A
  failed publish is recovered with "Re-run all jobs", never "Re-run failed
  jobs" (CONTRIBUTING "Cutting a release"). Never type a release's DOI: read
  it from Zenodo.
- Cite a paper in a public issue, PR or doc by its `https://doi.org/<DOI>`
  link, read from its record (`lit-search` confirms it), or, for a work with
  no DOI, by its publisher's or institution's page; never point into or name
  the private paper library there.

## Where to look

| You want to… | Go to |
|--------------|-------|
| Add an ns-3 version | nothing: the weekly run picks up a new upstream release (`tools/ns3_matrix.py`); an older one is built on demand with `workflow_dispatch` `versions` |
| Change what a release gets, a base image digest, or add a profile | `tools/ns3_matrix.py` (+ its test) and the `Dockerfile` profile `case` |
| Handle an image request (another distro, compiler, version) | the *Image request* form's issue; supported set and its reasons in README "Need another distribution…" and #19. The org's forms in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` are org-sync items (`forms = true`; swarm-routing/.github#318) |
| Add a stock ns-3 module to the images | `NS3_MODULES` in `docker/Dockerfile` (every downstream repo inherits it) |
| Change how contrib modules build | `docker/scripts/build-contrib.sh` (+ `test/smoke.sh`) |
| The reference image this was derived from | AntHocNet `docker/Dockerfile.ns3`, `.github/workflows/images.yml` |
| The org's invariants, labels, issue shape | [`swarm-routing/.github` CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| The reference implementation and its history | [`swarm-routing/AntHocNet`](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet) (`AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/adr/`) |
| Pick up open work | this repo's issues — highest open `priority:P*` first; newest open `handoff` issue for work in flight |
